When developing new software, organizations face a series of critical questions: <br/> should we use the public cloud? If so which one? <br/> Which cloud services should we use and how? <br/> How should we build and package our applications? <br/> If using containers, how do we build our kubernetes stack? <br/> Should we use managed services or not? <br/> How to create a reliable continuous deployment process? <br/> Which open source tools should we use and why? <br/> How to implement monitoring and logging? How to scale? <br/> How to implement everything in a cost effective way? <br/>
If you’re facing any of these challenges, we’re here to help. "
